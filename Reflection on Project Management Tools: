Using GitHub’s project management features like milestones, issues, and project boards can  improve team collaboration and  keep the project organized. 
Milestones help the team focus on important goals by breaking down the project into smaller steps.
Issues allow team members to clearly define tasks, bugs, or feature requests. 
This makes it easier to assign work to the right people, and everyone can see what tasks need to be completed.
Project boards give a visual overview of the project. 
By organizing tasks into columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," the whole team can quickly see the status of each task.
One challenge  will face  that when  we using these tools we sholud sure that everyone on the team updates the issues and the project board regularly.
If someone forgets to update the  tasks to the correct column or doesn’t report progress, it can cause confusion.
It’s also important that everyone is familiar with GitHub.
